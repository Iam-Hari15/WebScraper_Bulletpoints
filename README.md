Cryptography is the science of securing communication by converting data into unreadable formats.

It ensures confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication.

Modern cryptography is based on complex mathematical algorithms.

Symmetric and asymmetric encryption are two primary types used today.

Public key infrastructure (PKI) is crucial for secure web communication.

Digital signatures use cryptographic algorithms to verify message authenticity.

Hash functions are used to protect data from tampering by generating unique output.

Cryptography is essential in banking, military, cloud computing, and messaging.

Strong encryption techniques prevent unauthorized access and data breaches.

Future trends include quantum cryptography and post-quantum algorithms.
